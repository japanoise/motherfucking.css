# Motherfucking.css

This is a very minimal css file, used for my website. It works well for mobile
and desktop. It's inspired by the motherfucking websites.

## Eink

eink-kramdown.css provides a nice minimal theme for kramdown's highlighted code
blocks.

## Meta tag

Please use this meta tag in the `<head>` section of your html files when using
motherfucking.css; it makes things look nice on mobile.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
